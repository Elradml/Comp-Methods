# Comp Methods Solution

The code was made for a two person assignment investigating different numerical scehemes for solving the linear advection equation which is a PDE
The problem is setup to assume a disturbance in a tube a t = 0 along a length L = 100m
2 sets of boundary & initial conditions were used each having their own analytical solution

The four numerical method investigated were:
1) Explicit Upwind FTBS
2) Implicit Upwind FTBS
3) Lax-Wendroff
4) Ritchmyer multi-step
